        <h2>Akan Name Generator</h2>
        <p>
            In many parts of Ghana, and elsewhere in West Africa, a person's name is determined
            by the day of the week on which <br> she/he was born.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enter your birthday and gender below to read your day name in Ashanti Twi, a dialect
            of Akan and the most widely spoken <br> language in Ghana.
        </p>
